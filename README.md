# HR Attrition Prediction Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes HR data to understand and predict **employee attrition**.  
The goal is to identify the main factors that influence whether employees leave the company and build a machine learning model to predict attrition.  

The project also includes a **Power BI dashboard** for visualization and reporting.

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. **Data Exploration** – Analyzed distributions, relationships, and correlations.  
2. **Preprocessing** – Encoding categorical data, scaling numeric features, and handling missing values.  
3. **Modeling** – Built a **Logistic Regression** model to predict attrition.  
4. **Evaluation** – Used Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC AUC for model performance.  
5. **Visualization** – Created an interactive **Power BI dashboard** for insights.

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard
The dashboard includes:  
- **KPIs**: Overall Attrition %, Average Monthly Income, Average Age, Average Years at Company.  
- **Visuals**:  
  - Attrition by Job Role  
  - Attrition by Age Group  
  - Attrition by Gender  
  - Attrition by Monthly Income  
  - Attrition by Overtime  
- **Slicers**: Department, Job Role, Gender, Education Field

## 🚀 Tools Used
- **Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)**  
- **Google Colab / Jupyter**  
- **Power BI**  

---

## ✅ Results
- The Logistic Regression model achieved around **76% accuracy**.  
- The Power BI dashboard helps HR managers explore attrition patterns interactively.
